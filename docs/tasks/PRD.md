# Product Requirements Document: Python Todo Application

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Python-based Todo application. The application will feature both a web interface (using FastAPI) and a command-line interface (CLI) using Click and Rich. The core objective is to provide a robust, modular, and testable application following clean architecture principles, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.

## 2. Goals

- Provide a functional Todo application with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) capabilities.
- Offer two distinct but functionally equivalent interfaces: a web UI and a CLI.
- Demonstrate clean architecture principles with a clear separation of business logic from interface specifics.
- Ensure high testability of the core logic.
- Lay a foundation for future extensibility (e.g., database integration, user authentication).

## 3. Core Features (CRUD for Todo Items)

### 3.1. Todo Item Structure

Each todo item will have:
- **ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., integer, UUID).
- **Title**: A short description of the todo item.
- **Description** (Optional): A more detailed description.
- **Completed**: A boolean indicating whether the todo item is completed.
- **Created At**: Timestamp of when the todo item was created.

### 3.2. Operations

- **Create**: Add a new todo item.
- **Read**: View all todo items or a specific todo item by ID.
- **Update**: Modify an existing todo item (e.g., change title, description, or completion status).
- **Delete**: Remove a todo item.

## 4. Architecture and Technology Stack

### 4.1. Project Structure

The project will be organized into the following top-level directories:
- `core`: Contains the core business logic, entities, and interfaces (e.g., Todo repository interface). This layer should be independent of specific frameworks.
- `web`: Contains the FastAPI application, including API endpoints, data models specific to the web interface, and dependency injection setup for web routes.
- `cli`: Contains the Click application, including CLI commands, input parsing, and Rich integration for output.

### 4.2. Technologies

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI for the web interface.
- **CLI Framework**: Click for building command-line commands.
- **Rich**: For enhancing CLI output with colors and formatting.
- **Data Storage**: In-memory (Python list or dictionary) for simplicity, adhering to the requirement for shared core logic.
- **Type Hinting**: Extensive use of Python type annotations for better code readability and maintainability.

### 4.3. Design Principles

- **Clean Architecture**: Strict separation of concerns, with `core` being the innermost layer.
- **Modularity**: Components should be self-contained and reusable.
- **Testability**: Core logic should be easily testable with unit tests, independent of I/O or framework specifics.
- **Dependency Injection**: Utilize dependency injection patterns (e.g., constructor injection) to facilitate testing and manage dependencies, especially for the core logic's interaction with data storage.
- **Future Extensibility**: Design should allow for easy swapping of data storage (e.g., to a database) or adding new features (e.g., user authentication) without significant refactoring of the core logic.

## 5. Development Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Implement basic unit tests for the `core` business logic to ensure correctness and maintainability.
- **Type Annotations**: All new code should be fully type-annotated.
- **Functional Equivalence**: Both the CLI and web interfaces must provide the same set of functionalities for managing todo items.

## 6. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for Initial Version)

- Database integration (e.g., SQLAlchemy with SQLite/PostgreSQL).
- User authentication and authorization.
- More advanced error handling and logging.
- Comprehensive testing (integration, end-to-end).
- Deployment considerations.
